# Scarne's Dice Game

As part of a Applied CS Skills with Google workshop developed a rendition of the Scarne's Dice game.

The game allows a user to play against a computer.
The user has two options: roll the dice or hold.
If the user rolls the dice and the get a 1, their turn score becomes 0 
and the computer gets to roll the dice.
Is the user chooses to hold they add their current turn score
to their overall score.

First opponent to 100 wins the game.
